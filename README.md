# Europarty

Each year, thousands of families and friends all over Europe and beyond host Eurovision parties to celebrate this fun musical event. A fun party activity at these gatherings would be to allow party guests to do their own voting, coming up with a parallel set of winners that represents the votes of the people at the party rather than those of Europe all up.

That means, at a super high level, creating a site where:
- The site is aware of a variety of events that are occurring for which it wants to enable voting.
- Party hosts can create a page for their party
- That party page can be made accessible to guests at an easy URL
- The guests can vote for their top choices
- Once they are ready, the host gets results tallied by the system
